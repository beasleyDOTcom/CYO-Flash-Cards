# CYO Flash Cards
My name is Beasley, and I made this website.
Creating your own flash cards can activate multiple areas of your brean increasing both the speed of retention and the quality.
The more cards you make the less likely you are to get the same card over and over again.
Take time to think about what you want to learn and how you want to ask the question to lead yourself to the answer you provide.
This can help change the way you think about an idea and see it from a different angle--both of which, help imprint the information in your mind.
I made this page because I wanted to make something I felt would be useful for me and others in the future.
I debated whether to make this a multiple choice but then I remembered MVP from 101.
I spent a good deal of time trying to animate a card flipping over but couldn't figure out how to connect it all so I had to keep it kinda basic.. Till the Future!!
I started this the morning of june 10th 2020 and I am at a function/comfortable spot at 2 am on the 12th. 
I'd like to do more, but I am happy both with what I've accomplished and what I had to struggle to learn to make this happen. Cheers!
